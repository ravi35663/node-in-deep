/*
==> Why Choose Node.js :
-> It is single threaded and highly efficient to develop scalable products.
-> Node is able to perform asynchronous work efficiently.

==> Uses of Node.Js:
    -> Used to build rest APIs:
	Node.js allows developers to write real-time applications while providing scope for 
    mobile application development in JavaScript. The most popular type of applications 

    —> API services —
    expose JSON objects with a REST API for the client to consume.

    -> Used to build streaming web applications:
	 Node.js has a built-in streams module which allows it to transmit a huge amount of data 
     in chunks, sequentially. That is why it is perfect for services for listening to music or 
     watching videos without the need to download the content.

    -> Real time web applications:
     Thanks to the event loop API and WebSockets it is possible to build real-time web applications
     like chat, video conference room or collaboration tools helping coworkers to work on the same
     document at the same time (like GoogleDocs).
-> Microservices:
	Apart from that, Node can also be used to build microservices — applications as a collection of
    small services working independently.
-> IoT Devices you can build with Node.js
				... etc
