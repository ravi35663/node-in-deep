//Maintaining a Single Event-Emitter Instance Application wide
/*
    -> A node application is generally 100s of files. This gets challenging to maintain by a 
       single copy of the EventEmitter instance throughout the application.

    -> There is a simple strategy to create and maintain a singleton copy for an EventEmitter 
       instance.
    -> you can set any key in your application's object so that you can access it anywhere in 
       your application
    e.g.
    const eventEmitter = require('events)
    const express = require('express')
    const app = express()

    app.set('eventEmitter',new eventEmitter()) // app.set(key,value) :- it will store any key-value in your app's object


    *access it from any module of the application
    console.log(app.get('eventEmitter'));

    Is an Event Emitter Synchronous or Asynchronous?

    Output:

        Line C
        Line B
        Line D
    -> hence the event emitter is synchronous

/*
    How and Where NodeJS Internally uses Event Emitters
    -> NodeJs internally uses event emitters widely across its environment. 
       The first example we can think of is streams.
    -> Streams extend event emitters. Streams are built on top of event emitters that raise 
       predefined events like open, end, data, etc.

    -> The following code snippet is a simple example of a stream — explaining the resemblance 
       with event emitters.

    let chunkIndex = 0;
const readStream = createReadStream("./data.txt");

readStream.on("open", () => {
    console.log("Started Reading...");
});

readStream.on("end", () => {
    console.log("Completed Reading...");
});

readStream.on("data", chunk => {
    console.log("Chunk: " + ++chunkIndex);
    console.log("-----------------------------------------");
    console.log(chunk);
    console.log("\n");
});
