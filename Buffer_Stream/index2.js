    ==> A Writable Stream
    --> A writable stream is a stream of data that is created to write some streaming data.
        For example, creating a write stream to write a text file for some streaming data.

    const fs = require('fs')
    const writeStream = fs.createWriteStream('./dump.txt');
    
    * In the above code, we created a write stream to write some streaming data to a file 
      named dump.txt.

    * Running the above two lines creates a file with the named 'dump.txt' but without any 
      data inside it.

    * to actually write some data into it, we can use writeStream.write('some data')
    writeStream.write('hello\n');
    writeStream.write('world\n');
*/

const fs = require('fs')
const writeStream = fs.createWriteStream('./dump.txt');

// * In the above code, we created a write stream to write some streaming data to a file

    ==> Stream Piping and Unpiping:
    --> In an Express application, the req (request) and res (response) for a request handler 
        are streams. A req is a readable stream of data whereas res is a writable stream of 
        data.
    --> Considering this for an HTTP request, we have to serve a really large file, 
        we can do so by using streams.
