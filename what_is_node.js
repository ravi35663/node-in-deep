/*
==> What is Node.js and where you can use it:
-> Node.js is an open-source, server-side javascript runtime environment built on google chrome V8
   javascript engine.
-> The V8 chrome javascript engine allows developers to write javascript outside the browser.
-> Node.js is used to write server side scripts of the applications.
-> we can build scalable and high performance applications using node.js
-> runtime environment includes everything that you need to run/execute a javascript written program
   at the server side.
-> both your browser javascript and node.js run on chrome V8 engine. This V8 engine converts your
   javascript code into faster machine code (low level code) so that your code runs without needing
   any further interpretation.
-> Node.js package ecosystem, npm is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world.
-> Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient.
-> I/O refers to input/output.It can be anything from reading/writing a local file to making an http
   request to any server.
-> I/O takes time and hence blocks other functions. That is the issue node.js is solving with a
   non-blocking I/O feature.
-> Javascript is single threaded (Not really single threaded but it has a single threaded event-loop)
-> V8 is an open-source runtime environment which is written is C++.
-> Javascript --> V8(C++) --> Machine code
-> There are many javascript runtimes like chrome V8, SpiderMonkey by Mozila, Chakra by Microsoft and
   javascript core by apple etc.
-> event-driven meaning in node.js is server always ready for actions/events to listen. I.e when any
   button is clicked an action with that button will happen at server side in terms of API or
   something else.
-> Event-Driven means, node is always ready for the events that are going to occur at server side.
-> When we say "event-driven," we mean that the program is designed to respond to specific actions or
   events, just like your birthday party. The events happen on your birthday like cake cutting, gift
   Opening kinds of events occur at nodes . That is why node.js is called event driven .
-> In Node.js, there is a special tool called ‘EventEmitter’ that helps with managing these events.
   It's like a party organizer that keeps track of what events can happen and what should be done
   when they happens.

==> Blocking I/O:-
->suppose user1 and user2 made a request to the server. user1’s request is processed and unless the
  response of user1 is not completed or printed to the screen user2’s request would not be initiated.
  This is what we call blocking I/O.

==> Non-Blocking I/O :-
-> Because of the node.js event-loop, node js performs non-blocking I/O.
-> on the other hand when user2 made a request, instead of waiting request of user1’s to completed
   server proceeds with user2’s request without using multiple thread but using single thread
   event-loop.
-> this non-blocking I/O eliminates the need of multithreading since the server can handle multiple
   requests at the same time with the help of event-loop.

==> Require :-
-> require is a function, and it accepts parameters as “path” and returns module.exports things.
-> require does three things
    1) require load modules that come bundled with node.js like file system(fs) and http from node.js APIs.
    2) require load third party libraries such express, mongoose ..etc that you install from npm.
    3) Require let you require your own files and modularize the project.

==> Events in Node.js :-
-> Something that has happened in our app that we can respond to is known as events.
-> there are two types of events in node.
    1) System Events: C++ core from library called libuv.(i.e finished reading a file)
    2) Custom Events: Javascript core events
